  For many students the study of mathematics consists mainly of the study of functions, a class of objects that reflect a physical intuition -- a relationship between two quantities.
  Math textbooks present a plethora of example functions: the position of a car on the highway or a boat on the river, the balance of an interest-bearing bank account or even abstract mathematical relations like $y=x^2$.
  Such relations are the object of study in elementary algebra and calculus. 
  The prevalence of their study in mathematics indicates the utility of functional thinking and its applicability to widely varied problems.
  However, such concepts are limited in generality, requiring a variety of special rules and exceptions to avoid
