\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Above all, this thesis would not have happened without my advisor, Jerry Shurman.
You taught me that in mathematics style is content, as well as how to shape that content into something worthwhile.

To my professors at Reed, and my teachers elsewhere: without you I would have never gotten here.
Every word of this thesis is built on years of what you taught me, so thank you for the solid foundation.

I want to thank my family for their constant support and availability.
Every day I remember everything you've done for me; this thesis is for you.
Thank you!

Kaylee, writing a thesis is not easy, but writing one without you would be impossible.
Thank you for being there every morning and every night, for prodding me to work more, and for nagging me to work less. 
You made every day brighter and kept me sane.
I love~you.
