  \chapter{Topology on Schwartz Functions}
    \label{ch:topons}
    Our development of Schwartz functions and tempered distributions showed that these spaces have nice properties with regard to the Fourier transform.
    However, our discussion has mainly concerned itself with set-theoretic notions---that is, with the properties of elements of these spaces.
    We hope that these spaces are also nicely behaved with regard to \emph{topological} properties such as limits and continuity.
    Particularly, understanding \S as a topological space allows us to easily understand $\S^*$, as duals of topological spaces are well understood.

    \section{Spaces of Functions}
      We are interested in \emph{topology} on spaces of functions, with the goal of finding a topology for the space of distributions.
      Recall:
      \begin{defn}
        A \emph{topology} on a set $X$ is a set $\tau\subseteq2^X$ that satisfies:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item $\emptyset,X\in\tau$,
          \item $\tau$ is closed under arbitrary union,
          \item $\tau$ is closed under finite intersection.
        \end{itemize}

      Given a set $X$ with a \emph{metric} $d:X^2\rightarrow\R$, we take all sets of the form $\{x\in X:d(x,y)<\alpha\}$ for $y\in X$ and $\alpha\in\R$ as a basis for a set $\tau_d$, which is verifiably a topology on $X$.

      Finally, for a vectorspace $X$ over $\C$ with a \emph{norm} $|\cdot|:X\rightarrow\R$, we define a metric on $X$ by $d(x,y)=|x-y|$, and so can define a topology on $X$ by means of this metric.
      \end{defn}

      This final form of this definition is particularly useful in this context, as sets of functions \emph{naturally} form vectorspaces over \C, by defining operations pointwise:
      \begin{align*}
        (f+g)(x) &= f(x)+g(x)\\
        (a\cdot f)(x) &= a\cdot f(x)
      \end{align*}
      As such, we need only introduce a concept of \emph{size} on functions in order to get a topology on a set of functions (supposing it is closed under vectorspace operations).
      Importantly though, we care much more about the resulting \emph{topology} than we do about the norm, as topology is a more general (and relevant) concept.

      Consider the space $C^0(\R)$ of complex-valued, continuous, integrable functions on $\R$, which is a vectorspace over $\C$.
      Give $C^0(\R)$ the ``sup norm'' and its associated metric:
      \begin{align*}
        |f|_{C^0} &= \sup_{x\in\R}|f(x)|\\
        d(f,g) &= |f-g|_{C^0}
      \end{align*}
      It is trivial that the sup norm is positive-definite and obeys the triangle inequality, by properties of the absolute value and sup.
      Thus the following completes the proof that sup norm is in fact a norm:
      \begin{claim}
        The sup norm on $C^0(\R)$ is always finite.
        \begin{proof}
          Let $f\in C^0(\R)$.
          Because $f$ is integrable, it must vanish at infinity.
          Thus, given $\varepsilon>0$ we have $N_\varepsilon>0$ such that $|x|>N\Rightarrow f(x)<\varepsilon$.
          This allows us to write
          \begin{align*}
            |f|_{C^0} &= \sup_{x\in\R}|f(x)|\\
            &= \max\left(\sup_{|x|<N_\varepsilon}|f(x)|,\varepsilon\right)
          \end{align*}
          which is finite by the extreme value theorem.
        \end{proof}
      \end{claim}

      The simplicity of the following proof illustrates the naturalness of the sup norm applied to $C^0(\R)$.
      \todo{Why is this important?}
      \begin{claim}
        For $x\in\R$, the evaluation functional $C^0(\R)\rightarrow\C$ given by $f\mapsto f(x)$ is continuous.
        \begin{proof}
          Given $\varepsilon > 0$, $d(f,g)<\varepsilon \Rightarrow |f(x)-g(x)|<\varepsilon$ for all $x$, showing continuity.
  %        Given $\varepsilon > 0$, $d(f,g)<\varepsilon \Rightarrow |f(x)-g(x)|<\varepsilon$ because $\forall x$ $|f(x)-g(x)|\le\sup_{y\in\R}|f(y)-g(y)|=d(f,g)$.
  %        Thus the evaluation functional is continuous.
        \end{proof}
      \end{claim}

      Finally, we see that we have managed to construct a nicely behaved topological space:
      \begin{thm}
        The space $C^0(\R)$ of continuous integrable functions is \emph{complete}.
        \begin{proof}
          Consider a Cauchy sequence of $C^0$ functions $\{f_i\}$.
          First we will see that this sequence has a pointwise limit, and then that this limit is in fact $C^0$.

          Given $\varepsilon<0$ pick $N$ such that for $i,j>N$ we have $|f_i-f_j|<\varepsilon$.
          Then for any $x\in\R$, $|f_i(x)-f_j(x)|<\varepsilon$, and so the sequence of complex outputs $\{f_i(x)\}$ is Cauchy and has a limit $f(x)$.
          Thus the pointwise limit of $\{f_i\}$ is $f$.
         
          Now for $\varepsilon'>0$ take $j>N$ so that $|f_j(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon'$.
          \todo{finish}
        \end{proof}
      \end{thm}
      \begin{rmk}
        Note that this completeness is a consequence of our norm forcing sequences of functions to converge \emph{uniformly}.
        This is particularly important as pointwise limits of continuous functions need not be continuous!
      \end{rmk}
      \begin{rmk}
        Thus, being complete with respect to the topology arising from a norm, $C^0(\R)$ is a \emph{Banach} space, by definition.
      \end{rmk}

    \subsection{Spaces of differentiable functions}
      We now turn to the issue of \emph{differentiability}.
      Define the space 
      \begin{align*}
        C^k(\R) = \{f\in C^0(\R) : f'\in C^{k-1}(\R)\}
      \end{align*}
      Note that this definition requires that all $k+1$ derivatives $f,f',\ldots,f^{(k)}$ be $C^0$, and so they are \emph{all} continuous and integrable.
      Give $C^k(\R)$ the topology of the $C^k$-norm:
      \begin{align*}
        |f|_{C^k} = \sum_{i=0}^k |f^{(i)}|_{C^0} = \sum_{i=0}^k \sup_{x\in\R}|f^{(i)}(x)|
      \end{align*}
      \begin{rmk}
        \todo{sup sup version}
      \end{rmk}
      \begin{rmk}
        \todo{differentiation: $C^k\rightarrow C^{k-1}$ is continuous}
      \end{rmk}
      \begin{claim}
        \todo{$C^k(\R)$ is complete}
      \end{claim}

    \subsection{Spaces of rapidly-decaying functions}
      Now consider the issue of \emph{decay}.
      Let $f\in C^0(\R)$.
      By definition, $f$ vanishes at infinity and is integrable, and so must decay faster than $1/x$.
      Thus the function $x\cdot f(x)$ vanishes at infinity (but may not be integrable).
      Define
      \begin{align*}
        C^k_\ell(\R) = \{f\in C^k(\R):x^\ell f^{(i)}(x)\text{ vanishes at infinity }\forall i\le k\}
      \end{align*}
      \begin{thm}
        $C^k_\ell(\R)$ is complete in the $C^k$-norm topology.
        \begin{proof}
          \todo{this}
        \end{proof}
      \end{thm}
