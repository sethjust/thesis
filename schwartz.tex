  \chapter{Topology on Schwartz Functions}

    \label{ch:topons}
    Our development of Schwartz functions and tempered distributions showed that these spaces have nice properties with regard to the Fourier transform.
    However, our discussion has mainly concerned itself with set-theoretic notions---that is, with the properties of elements of these spaces.
    We hope that these spaces are also nicely behaved with regard to \emph{topological} properties such as limits and continuity.
    Particularly, understanding \S as a topological space allows us to easily understand $\S^*$, as duals of topological spaces are well understood.

    Outline of things to come:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Topology on \S
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Approximation by sequences
          \item Uniform convergence
          \item $\sup$ norm; $\sup\sup$ norm
          \item ???
        \end{itemize}
      \item Topology of $\S^*$
      \item Classical functions (of moderate growth) as distributions
    \end{itemize}
