  \chapter{Topology on Schwartz Functions}
    \label{ch:topons}
    Our development of Schwartz functions and tempered distributions showed that these spaces have nice properties with regard to the Fourier transform.
    However, our discussion has mainly concerned itself with set-theoretic notions---that is, with the properties of elements of these spaces.
    We hope that these spaces are also nicely behaved with regard to \emph{topological} properties such as limits and continuity.
    Particularly, understanding \S as a topological space allows us to easily understand $\S^*$, as duals of topological spaces are well understood.

    \section{Spaces of Functions}
      \label{sec:spcoffunc}
      We are interested in \emph{topology} on spaces of functions, with the goal of finding a topology for the space of distributions.
      Recall:
      \begin{defn}
        A \emph{topological space} is a set $X$ and a set $\tau$ of subsets of $X$ that satisfies:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The empty set $\emptyset$ and the whole space $X$ are elements of $\tau$,
          \item $\tau$ is closed under arbitrary union,
          \item $\tau$ is closed under finite intersection.
        \end{itemize}
        We call $\tau$ a \emph{topology on $X$}.

        Given a set $X$ with a \emph{metric} $d:X^2\rightarrow\R$, we take all sets of the form $\{x\in X:d(x,y)<\alpha\}$ for $y\in X$ and $\alpha\in\R$ as a basis for a set $\tau_d$, which is verifiably a topology on $X$.
      \end{defn}

      Working with this definition for arbitrary sets is not fun---it is only by taking advantage of additional structure on $X$ (such as a metric) that the topology is easily understood, in part because it allows us to apply physical intuition about \emph{size}. 
      We hope that we can find some structure in spaces of functions that will allow us to easily understand the topologies we work with.
      Recall:
      \begin{defn}
        A \emph{norm} on a vectorspace $X$ over a field $F$ is a function
        \begin{align*}
          |\cdot|_X:X\longrightarrow\R
        \end{align*}
        that satisfies for all $x,y\in X$, $a\in F$:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Positive Scalability: $|ax|_X=|a|\cdot|x|_X$
          \item Triangle Inequality: $|x+y|_X\le|x|_X+|y|_X$
          \item Separation of points: $|x|_X=0\Longleftrightarrow x=0_X$.
        \end{itemize}
        Notationally, some subscripts are dropped and we distinguish between a norm and the real absolute-value function by context.
      \end{defn}

      Now suppose that $X$ is a normed vectorspace over $\C$.
      We define a metric on $X$ by $d(x,y)=|x-y|$, and so can define a topology on $X$ by means of this metric.
      This construction is particularly useful in our context, as sets of functions \emph{naturally} form vectorspaces over \C, by defining operations pointwise:
      \begin{align*}
        (f+g)(x) &= f(x)+g(x)\\
        (a\cdot f)(x) &= a\cdot f(x)
      \end{align*}
      As such, we need only introduce a concept of size (via a \emph{norm}) on functions in order to get a topology on a set of functions (supposing it is closed under vectorspace operations).
      Importantly though, we care much more about the resulting \emph{topology} than we do about the norm, as topology is a more general (and relevant) concept.

      Consider the space $C^0_0(\R)$ of complex-valued, continuous functions vanishing at infinity, which is a vectorspace over $\C$.
      Give $C^0_0(\R)$ the ``sup norm'' and its associated metric:
      \begin{align*}
        |f|_{C^0_0} &= \sup_{x\in\R}|f(x)|\\
        d(f,g) &= |f-g|_{C^0_0}
      \end{align*}
      It is trivial that the sup norm is positive-definite and obeys the triangle inequality, by properties of the absolute value and sup.
      Thus the following completes the proof that sup norm is in fact a norm:
      \begin{claim}
        The sup norm on $C^0_0(\R)$ is always finite.
        \begin{proof}
          Let $f\in C^0_0(\R)$, so it vanishes at infinity.
          Thus, given $\varepsilon>0$ we have $N>0$ such that $|x|>N\Rightarrow f(x)<\varepsilon$.
          This allows us to write
          \begin{align*}
            |f|_{C^0_0} &= \sup_{x\in\R}|f(x)|\\
            &= \max\left(\varepsilon,\,\sup_{|x|<N}|f(x)|\right)
          \end{align*}
          which is finite by the extreme value theorem.
        \end{proof}
      \end{claim}

      The simplicity of the following proof illustrates the naturalness of the sup norm applied to $C^0_0(\R)$.
      \todo{Why is this important?}
      \begin{claim}
        For $x\in\R$, the evaluation functional $C^0_0(\R)\rightarrow\C$ given by $f\mapsto f(x)$ is continuous.
        \begin{proof}
          Given $\varepsilon > 0$, $d(f,g)<\varepsilon \Rightarrow |f(x)-g(x)|<\varepsilon$ for all $x$, showing continuity.
  %        Given $\varepsilon > 0$, $d(f,g)<\varepsilon \Rightarrow |f(x)-g(x)|<\varepsilon$ because $\forall x$ $|f(x)-g(x)|\le\sup_{y\in\R}|f(y)-g(y)|=d(f,g)$.
  %        Thus the evaluation functional is continuous.
        \end{proof}
      \end{claim}

      Finally, we see that we have managed to construct a nicely behaved topological space:
      \begin{thm}
        \label{thm:c00complete}
        The space $C^0_0(\R)$ of continuous functions vanishing at infinity is \emph{complete}.
      \end{thm}
      \begin{proof}
        Consider a Cauchy sequence of $C^0_0$ functions $\{f_i\}$.
        First we will see that this sequence has a pointwise limit.

        Given $\varepsilon<0$ pick $N$ such that for $i,j>N$ we have $|f_i-f_j|<\varepsilon$.
        Then for any $x\in\R$, $|f_i(x)-f_j(x)|<\varepsilon$, and so the sequence of complex outputs $\{f_i(x)\}$ is Cauchy and has a limit $f(x)$.
        Thus the pointwise limit of $\{f_i\}$ is $f$.
       
        Now for $\varepsilon'>0$ take $j>N$ so that $|f_j(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon'$.
        Then for $i>N$
        \begin{align*}
          |f_i(x)-f(x)|\le|f_i(x)-f_j(x)|+|f_j(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon+\varepsilon'\text{.}
        \end{align*}
        Taking the limit as $\varepsilon'\rightarrow0$, we see $|f_i(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$ for \emph{all} $x$.
        Thus the convergence $\{f_i\}\rightarrow f$ is \emph{uniform} in $x$.
        Quoting the fact that the limit of continuous is continuous when convergence is uniform, we see that $f$ is continuous.\footnotemark

        It remains to show only that $f$ vanishes at infinity.
        Take $\varepsilon$ and $N$ as above, and fix some $i>N$.
        Then $|f_i(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$ for all $x$.
        Let $\varepsilon'>0$ and choose $M$ such that $|x|>M\Rightarrow |f_i(x)|<\varepsilon'$.
        Then
        \begin{align*}
          |f(x)|\le|f_i(x)-f(x)|+|f_i(x)|<\varepsilon+\varepsilon'\text{,}
        \end{align*}
        so for large $|x|$, we can make $f(x)$ arbitrarily small, and so $f\in C^0_0$.
      \end{proof}
      \footnotetext{This is easily verified by combining the inequalities above with the continuity of the $f_i$.}
      \begin{rmk}
        Thus, being complete with respect to the topology arising from a norm, $C^0_0(\R)$ is a \emph{Banach} space, by definition.
      \end{rmk}
      \begin{rmk}
        Note that this completeness is a consequence of our norm forcing sequences of functions to converge \emph{uniformly}.
        This is particularly important as pointwise limits of continuous functions need not be continuous!
      \end{rmk}

    \subsection{Spaces of differentiable functions}
      We now turn to the issue of \emph{differentiability}.
      For $k>0$ define the space 
      \begin{align*}
        C^k_0(\R) = \{f\in C^0_0(\R) : f'\in C^{k-1}_0(\R)\}
      \end{align*}
      Note that this definition requires that all $k+1$ derivatives $f,f',\ldots,f^{(k)}$ be $C^0_0$, and so they are \emph{all} continuous and vanish at infinity.
      Give $C^k_0(\R)$ the topology of the $C^k$-norm:
      \begin{align*}
        |f|_{C^k} = \sum_{0\le i\le k} |f^{(i)}|_{C^0} = \sum_{0\le i\le k} \sup_{x\in\R}|f^{(i)}(x)|
      \end{align*}
      Note that for $k=0$, this is exactly the $C^0$ norm.
      \begin{rmk}
        The $C^k$ norm (or ``sum~sup'' norm) gives the same topology as the ``sup~sup'' norm:
        \begin{align*}
          |f|=\sup_{0\le i\le k}|f^{(i)}|_{C^0_0}=\sup_{0\le i\le k}\sup_{x\in\R}|f^{(i)}(x)|
        \end{align*}
        because for complex numbers $a_1,\ldots,a_k$
        \begin{align*}
          \sup_i a_i \le \sum_i a_i \le (k-1) \sup_i a_i\text{.}
        \end{align*}
        Thus the two can be used interchangeably, as we are concerned only with the resultant topology.
      \end{rmk}
      \begin{rmk}
        \todo{differentiation: $C^k_0\rightarrow C^{k-1}_0$ is continuous}
      \end{rmk}
      \begin{thm}
        \label{thm:ck0complete}
        $C^k_0(\R)$ is complete in the $C^k$-norm topology.
      \end{thm}
      \begin{proof}
        Consider the case $k=1$; this will extend inductively to all $k$.
        Let $\{f_i\}$ be Cauchy in $C^k_0$.
        Because both sequences $\{f_i\}$ and $\{f_i'\}$ are in $C^0_0$, by definition of the $C^0_0$ (sup) norm and $C^k_0$ norm, each is Cauchy in $C^0_0$.
        Thus by \thref{thm:c00complete} each sequence converges uniformly pointwise, so we can write:
        \begin{align*}
          &f(x)=\lim_n f_i(x) &g(x)=\lim_n f_i'(x)
        \end{align*}
        We now hope to show that $f$ is differentiable, and so an element of $C^k_0$.
        Since each $f_i$ is continuous and differentiable, write
        \begin{align*}
          f_i(x)-f_i(a) = \int_a^x f_i'(t)\,dt
        \end{align*}
        Taking the limit, and exchanging limit and integral (by the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem)
        \begin{align*}
          \lim_i f_i(x)-f_i(a) &= \lim_i\int_a^x f_i'(t)\,dt\\
          &= \int_a^x\lim_if_i(t)\,dt\\
          f(x)-f(a) &= \int_a^x g(t)\,dt
        \end{align*}
        so by the fundamental theorem of calculus, $f'=g$, and so $f\in C^k_0$.
      \end{proof}

    \subsection{Spaces of decaying functions}
      \label{sec:decayfunc}
      Now consider the issue of \emph{decay}.
      Recall that Schwartz functions are \emph{rapidly decaying}, so their product with any power of $x$ vanishes at infinity.
      For $\ell\ge0$ define (for now)
      \begin{align*}
        C^0_\ell(\R) = \{f\in C^0_0(\R):(1+x^2)^\ell f(x)\in C^0_0\}
      \end{align*}
      with the norm:
      \begin{align*}
        |f| = |(1+x^2)^\ell f|_{C^0_0} = \sup_{x\in\R} |(1+x^2)^\ell f(x)|
      \end{align*}
      These definitions are slightly ugly -- secretly we want the $(1+x^2)$ to be an $x$, but importantly $(1+x^2)^\ell\ge1$ for all $x$ and $\ell$.
      As the next proof shows, this is important!
      Replacing $(1+x^2)^\ell$ with $x^\ell$ in the definition would allow our functions to be misbehaved near the origin, which would allow us to construct a non-convergent Cauchy sequence.
      \begin{thm}
        \label{thm:c0lcomplete}
        $C^0_\ell(\R)$ is complete in its topology.
      \end{thm}
      \begin{proof}
        Take a Cauchy sequence of $C^0_\ell$ functions $\{f_i\}$.
        Because each $f_i\in C^0_0$ we want to say that $\{f_i\}$ has a pointwise limit $f$ that itself is $C^0_0$, as in the proof of \thref{thm:c00complete}.
        However, this only holds if $\{f_i\}$ is Cauchy in $C^0_0$. 

        By hypothesis, given $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $N>0$ such that for all $i,j>N$
        \begin{align*}
          |(1+x^2)^\ell f_i - (1+x^2)^\ell f_j|_{C^0_0} < \varepsilon
        \end{align*}
        Calculate 
        \begin{align*}
          |(1+x^2)^\ell f_i - (1+x^2)^\ell f_j|_{C^0_0}
          &= \sup_{x\in\R}(1+x^2)^\ell|f_i(x)-f_j(x)|\\
          &\ge \sup_{x\in\R}|f_i(x)-f_j(x)|\\
          &= |f_i-f_j|_{C^0_0}
        \end{align*}
        So $|f_i-f_j|_{C^0_0}<\varepsilon$, and so $\{f_i\}\rightarrow f\in C^0_0$.
        Thus it remains only to show that $(1+x^2)^\ell f(x)$ is $C^0_0$.
        
        By hypothesis the sequence $\{(1+x^2)^\ell f_i\}$ in $C^0_0$ is Cauchy.
        Then it has a limit in $C^0_0$, say $g$.
        We hope that $g(x)=(1+x^2)^\ell f(x)$.
        For $\varepsilon>0$ use the fact that \emph{both} sequences are Cauchy to pick $i$ so that $|(1+x^2)^\ell f_i - g|<\varepsilon$ and $|f_i - f|<\varepsilon$.
        Then for all $x$ 
        \begin{align*}
          |g(x) - (1+x^2)^\ell f(x)| &\le |(1+x^2)^\ell f_i(x) - g(x)|+|(1+x^2)^\ell||f_i(x)-f(x)|\\
          &< \varepsilon + |(1+x^2)^\ell|\varepsilon
        \end{align*}
        Because $\varepsilon$ is arbitrarily small we can force $|g(x)-(1+x^2)^\ell f(x)|$ to become arbitrarily small for any $x$, and so we conclude that $g=(1+x^2)^\ell f$.
        \todo{make sure it's okay that this isn't uniform}
        Thus $(1+x^2)^\ell f$ is $C^0_0$, and so $f\in C^0_\ell$.
      \end{proof}

      With the basic cases proved, we now hope to define a Banach space that is parameterized by both smoothness and decay properties.
      We define
      \begin{align*}
        C^k_\ell(\R) = \{f\in C^k_0(\R):(1+x^2)^\ell f^{(i)}(x)\in C^{k-i}_0\text{ for all } i\le k\}
      \end{align*}
      with the norm
      \begin{align*}
        |f|_{C^k_\ell} = |(1+x^2)^\ell f|_{C^k} = \sum_{0\le i\le k} \sup_{x\in\R} |(1+x^2)^\ell f^{(i)}(x)|
      \end{align*}
      Note that for $k=0$, $C^k_\ell=C^0_\ell$, and their respective norms agree.
      \begin{thm}
        \label{thm:cklcomplete}
        $C^k_\ell(\R)$ is complete in its topology.
      \end{thm}
      \begin{proof}
        Again we consider the case of $k=1$ and allow the argument to extend inductively.\todo{give this some attention to make it solid}

        Take $\{f_i\}$ to be Cauchy in $C^k_\ell$.

        We want to show that the sequence is Cauchy in another norm, as in \thref{thm:c0lcomplete}.
        By hypothesis, given $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $N>0$ such that for all $i,j>N$
        \begin{align*}
          |(1+x^2)^\ell f_i - (1+x^2)^\ell f_j|_{C^k} < \varepsilon
        \end{align*}
        Calculate
        \begin{align*}
          |(1+x^2)^\ell f_i - (1+x^2)^\ell f_j|_{C^k}
          &= \sum_{0\le h\le k}\sup_{x\in\R}(1+x^2)^\ell|f_i^{(h)}(x)-f_j^{(h)}(x)|\\
          &\ge \sum_{0\le h\le k}\sup_{x\in\R}|f_i^{(h)}(x)-f_j^{(h)}(x)|\\
          &= |f_i-f_j|_{C^k}
        \end{align*}
        Thus $\{f_i\}$ is Cauchy in $C^k_0$.
        From \thref{thm:ck0complete} we then see that $\{f_i\}$ is Cauchy in $C^k_0$ and so $\{f_i\}\rightarrow f$ in $C^k_0$ and $\{f_i'\}\rightarrow g$ in $C^{k-1}_0$ with $f'=g$.

        We now only need to show that $(1+x^2)^\ell f\in C^k_0$ and $(1+x^2)^\ell g\in C^{k-1}_0$.
        If we can show that $\{f_i\}$ is Cauchy in $C^0_\ell$ then we'll see that $(1+x^2)^\ell f\in C^0_0$ by \thref{thm:c0lcomplete}.
        Similarly, if we show that $\{f_i'\}$ is Cauchy in $C^0_\ell$, we'll see that $(1+x^2)^\ell g\in C^0_0$, and can use that fact to show that $(1+x^2)^\ell f$ is in fact in $C^k_0$.
        Calculate
        \begin{align*}
          |(1+x^2)^\ell f_i - (1+x^2)^\ell f_j|_{C^k}
          &= \sum_{0\le h\le k}\sup_{x\in\R}(1+x^2)^\ell|f_i^{(h)}(x)-f_j^{(h)}(x)|\\
          &\ge \sup_{x\in\R}(1+x^2)^\ell|f_i(x)-f_j(x)|
        \end{align*}
        which is exactly the norm of $f_i-f_j$ in $C^0_\ell$.
        The same inequality with first derivatives allows us to see that both sequences are indeed Cauchy in $C^0_\ell$, and so $(1+x^2)^\ell f$ and $(1+x^2)^\ell g$ are elements of $C^0_0$.

        Finally we calculate
        \begin{align*}
          \frac{d}{dx}(1+x^2)^\ell f(x)
          &= (1+x^2)^\ell f'(x) + \ell(1+x^2)^{\ell-1}2xf(x)\\
          &\le (1+x^2)^\ell g(x) + 2\ell(1+x^2)^\ell f(x)
        \end{align*}
        We have just shown that both summands are $C^0_0$, and so vanish at infinity.
        Thus, by the definition of $C^k_0$, $f\in C^k_0$, and so $C^k_\ell$ is complete in its topology, and thus Banach.
      \end{proof}

    \section{Limits of Topological Spaces}
      \todo{decide what belongs in an appendix}
      \todo{worry about convexity}
      
      \noindent
      In \autoref{sec:spcoffunc} we constructed a space of functions with \emph{arbitrarily} many derivatives and arbitrarily fast decay and showed that this space can be given the topological structure of a Banach space.
      We hope that this work will allow us to find useful topological structure for the space of Schwartz functions, which have \emph{infinitely} many derivatives and infinitely fast decay.
      This is exactly the process of taking a limit---we want to say $\S=\lim\limits_{k,\ell}C^k_\ell$, but this tells us nothing about the \emph{topology} of such a limit.
      Rather than laboriously \emph{construct} such a topology, we hope that by \emph{characterizing} the behavior of the limit object we can see what the topology on \S must be.

      \subsection{Products of Topological Spaces}
        Thus we define the product by a mapping-property:
  %
  %      First we will define the \emph{product} of topological spaces; we will see that the \emph{limit} of objects will be a closed subspace of the corresponding product.
        \begin{defn}
          Consider a collection of non-empty topological sets $X_\alpha$, indexed by $\alpha\in A$, some (possibly uncountable) index set.
          The \emph{product} of the $X_\alpha$ is a topological space $X$ along with continuous \emph{projection maps} 
          \begin{align*}
            p_\alpha:X\longrightarrow X_\alpha
          \end{align*}
          such that for all topological spaces $Z$ with continuous maps $f_\alpha:Z\rightarrow X_\alpha$ there is a \emph{unique} continuous map 
          \begin{align*}
            f:Z\longrightarrow X
          \end{align*}
          satisfying $f_\alpha=p_\alpha\circ f$.
          (We say that $f_\alpha$ \emph{factors through} the $p_\alpha$ uniquely.)
        \end{defn}
        Pictorially, the definition of a product says that all triangles commute in the diagram
        \begin{displaymath}
          \xymatrix{
            && X \ar@/_/[dll] \ar@/_/[dl]^{p_\alpha} \ar@/^/[dr]_{p_\beta} \ar@/^/[drr] \\
            \cdots & X_\alpha && X_\beta & \cdots\\
            && Z \ar@/^/[ull] \ar@/^/[ul]_{f_\alpha} \ar@{-->}[uu]_f \ar@/_/[ur]^{f_\beta} \ar@/_/[urr]
           }
        \end{displaymath}

        \begin{claim}
          \label{claim:uniqprod}
          The product is \emph{unique}, up to (continuous) isomorphism.
          \begin{proof}
            Suppose we have a collection of topological spaces $X_\alpha$ and two products, $X$ with projection maps $p_\alpha$ and $Y$ with projection maps $q_\alpha$.
            Considering $X$ and putting $Y$ in the position of $Z$ from the definition we have a unique $q$ so that the triangles commute in
            \begin{displaymath}
              \xymatrix{
                && X \ar@/_/[dll] \ar@/_/[dl]^{p_\alpha} \ar@/^/[dr]_{p_\beta} \ar@/^/[drr] \\
                \cdots & X_\alpha && X_\beta & \cdots\\
                && Y \ar@/^/[ull] \ar@/^/[ul]_{q_\alpha} \ar@{-->}[uu]_q \ar@/_/[ur]^{q_\beta} \ar@/_/[urr]
               }
            \end{displaymath}
            so $q_\alpha=p_\alpha\circ q$.
            Reversing the positions of $X$ and $Y$ we have a unique $p:X\rightarrow Y$ so that $p_\alpha=q_\alpha\circ p$.
            Finally, we see that $p\circ q:X\rightarrow X$ makes the triangles commute in
            \begin{displaymath}
              \xymatrix{
                && X \ar@/_/[dll] \ar@/_/[dl]^{p_\alpha} \ar@/^/[dr]_{p_\beta} \ar@/^/[drr] \\
                \cdots & X_\alpha && X_\beta & \cdots\\
                && X \ar@/^/[ull] \ar@/^/[ul]_{p_\alpha} \ar@{-->}[uu]_{p\circ q} \ar@/_/[ur]^{p_\beta} \ar@/_/[urr]
               }
            \end{displaymath}
            Because $X$ is a product of the $X_\alpha$ by hypothesis, the map $p\circ q$ is unique.
            Because the identity mapping trivially satisfies the requirements for $p\circ q$, by uniqueness $p\circ q=id$, and so $p=q^{-1}$, and so $X$ and $Y$ are (continuously) isomorphic.
          \end{proof}
        \end{claim}

        Now that we have shown that our mapping-property definition gives a unique product, we hope to investigate properties of this product.
        From our definition, we hope that by considering various sets $Z$ and maps $f_\alpha$ we can learn about $X$.
        \todo{discussion around these proofs}
        \begin{claim}
          For $x,y\in X$, $x\ne y$, there is some $\alpha\in A$ such that $p_\alpha(x)\ne p_\alpha(y)$.
          \begin{proof}
            First, suppose that $p_\alpha(x)=p_\alpha(y)$ for all $\alpha$.
            Now let $Z$ be the one-element set $\{z\}$, and define $f_\alpha(z)=p_\alpha(x)$.
            By hypothesis, there exists some map $f:Z\rightarrow X$ satisfying $f_\alpha = p_\alpha \circ f$.
            Because maps from one-element sets are wholly determined by their images, we see that $p_\alpha(f(z))=f_\alpha(z)$, so $p_\alpha(f(z))=p_\alpha(x)$.
            But $f(z)=x$ \emph{and} $f(z)=y$ satisfy this condition, contradicting the uniqueness of the mapping $f$.
          \end{proof}
        \end{claim}

        \begin{claim}
          For any set $\{x_\alpha:\alpha\in A\}$ with $x_\alpha\in X_\alpha$ there exists some $x\in X$ such that $p_\alpha(x)=x_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$.
          \begin{proof}
            Again take the one-element set $Z=\{z\}$ with maps $f_\alpha(z)=x_\alpha$.
            Then $p_\alpha(f(z))=f_\alpha(z)=x_\alpha$.
            The element $x=f(z)$ is the desired one.
          \end{proof}
        \end{claim}
        
        Moving on, we hope to gain an understanding of the product as a \emph{set} before considering its topology.
        \begin{claim}
          As a \emph{set} the product of topological spaces is the normal (Cartesian) product
          \begin{align*}
            X = \{\{x_\beta:\beta\in A\}: x_\beta\in X_\beta\}
          \end{align*}
          with projections
          \begin{align*}
            p_\alpha(\{x_\beta:\beta\in A\}) = x_\alpha\text{.}
          \end{align*}
          \begin{proof}
            Consider a collection of $X_\alpha$.
            For a set $Z$ and some collection of maps $f_\alpha:Z\rightarrow X_\alpha$, the map $f:Z\rightarrow X$ given by
            \begin{align*}
              f(z) = \{f_\alpha(z):\alpha\in A\}
            \end{align*}
            will be compatible with the $p_\alpha$, and is visibly the only such map.
          \end{proof}
        \end{claim}

      \subsection{Product Topology}
        We now turn our attention to the \emph{topology} on a product of topological spaces.
        We hope that we can construct the appropriate topology on a product of spaces using only the topologies on those spaces and our mapping property definition.
        Recall that a map $f:A\rightarrow B$ is continuous iff the inverse image of open is open; that is, for any open $u\subseteq B$, the set
        \begin{align*}
          f^{-1}(u) = \{x\in A:f(x)\in P\}
        \end{align*}
        is open in $A$.

        Recall that our definition requires that all the maps be continuous.
        So, for any $u_\alpha$ open in $X_\alpha$, $p_\alpha^{-1}(u_\alpha)$ is open in $X$.
%        See that
%        \begin{align*}
%          p_\alpha^{-1}(u_\alpha)=\prod_{\beta\in A}
%          \begin{cases}
%            u_\alpha&\text{if }\alpha=\beta\\
%            X_\alpha&\text{if }\alpha\ne\beta
%          \end{cases}
%        \end{align*}
        Thus the topology on $X$ contains the topology generated by $\{p_\alpha^{-1}(u_\alpha):\alpha\in A\text{ and } u_\alpha\text{ open in }X_\alpha\}$.
        We say that the topology on $X$ is ``no coarser than'' this topology, as it cannot contain fewer sets.
        
        Now, given a family of continuous functions $f_\alpha:Z\rightarrow X_\alpha$, the (unique) induced map $f:Z\rightarrow X$ must be continuous, so for all $u$ open in $X$, $f^{-1}(u)$ is open in $Z$.
        Thus the topology on $X$ must be sufficiently coarse to satisfy $f^{-1}(u)$ being open in $Z$ for all $Z$ and $f$.
        Ideally, the topology given by the $X_\alpha$ is coarse enough to satisfy continuity of $f$.

        \begin{claim}
          The topology generated by 
          \begin{align*}
            \{p_\alpha^{-1}(u_\alpha):\alpha\in A\text{ and } u_\alpha\text{ open in }X_\alpha\}
          \end{align*}
          is coarse enough to be the product topology on $X$.
          \begin{proof}
            By the properties of inverse images it is sufficient to show that the inverse image of each element of the generating set is open in $Z$.
            Recall that $p_\alpha\circ f=f_\alpha$, so 
            \begin{align*}
              f^{-1}(p_\alpha^{-1}(u_\alpha)) = f_\alpha^{-1}(u_\alpha)
            \end{align*}
            See that each of the $f_\alpha$ are continuous, so for $u_\alpha$ open in $X_\alpha$, the set $f_\alpha^{-1}(u_\alpha)$ is open in $Z$.
            Thus each $f^{-1}(p_\alpha^{-1}(u_\alpha))$ is open in $Z$.
          \end{proof}
        \end{claim}

        \begin{rmk}
          The key point here was the \emph{existence} of a topology on the product that is consistent with our definition. 
          The topology generated from the $X_\alpha$ might have been \emph{too fine} for the map $f$ to be continuous, but we this is not the case.
          Having shown existence, the continuity of the isomorphism in \thref{claim:uniqprod} then shows that \emph{any} product with \emph{any}  topology (provided that it is consistent with the product definition) will be homeomorphic to the Cartesian product with the topology given above.
        \end{rmk}

      \subsection{Projective Limits}
        We now turn our attention to limits of topological spaces.
        Once again, we characterize the limit by a mapping property before constructing it.
        \begin{defn}[Projective Limit]
          Consider a collection of topological spaces $X_i$ with continuous \emph{transition maps} $\varphi_{i,i-1}:X_i\rightarrow X_{i-1}$:
          \begin{displaymath}
            \xymatrix{
              \cdots \ar[r]^{\varphi_{n+1,n}} & X_n \ar[r]^{\varphi_{n,n-1}} & X_{n-1} \ar[r]^{\varphi_{n-1,n-2}} & \cdots \ar[r]^{\varphi_{21}} & X_1 \ar[r]^{\varphi_{10}} & X_0
            }
          \end{displaymath}
          The \emph{projective limit} of the $X_i$, denoted $\lim\limits_i X_i$ (suppressing reference to the transition maps) is a topological space $X$ and maps $\varphi_n:X\rightarrow X_n$ that are \emph{compatible} with the maps $\varphi_{n,n-1}$, in the sense that 
          \begin{align*}
            \varphi_{n-1}=\varphi_{n,n-1}\circ\varphi_n
          \end{align*}
          so the triangles commute in
          \begin{displaymath}
            \xymatrix{
              X \ar@/^20pt/[rr]_{\varphi_1} \ar@/^30pt/[rrr]^{\varphi_0}
              & \cdots \ar[r]^{\varphi_{21}}
              & X_1 \ar[r]^{\varphi_{10}}
              & X_0
            }
          \end{displaymath}
          We require that for \emph{any} space $Z$ with maps $f_n:Z\rightarrow X_n$ that are compatible with the $\varphi_{n,n-1}$ there is a unique $f:Z\rightarrow X$ through which the $f_n$ factor.
          Thus, whenever the triangles commute in
          \begin{displaymath}
            \xymatrix{
               \cdots \ar[r]^{\varphi_{21}}
              & X_1 \ar[r]^{\varphi_{10}}
              & X_0
              \\ \cdots \\
              Z \ar[uur]^{f_1} \ar[uurr]^{f_0}
            }
          \end{displaymath}
          there is a unique map $f$ that makes the triangles commute in
          \begin{displaymath}
            \xymatrix{
              X \ar@/^20pt/[rr]_{\varphi_1} \ar@/^30pt/[rrr]^{\varphi_0}
              & \cdots \ar[r]^{\varphi_{21}}
              & X_1 \ar[r]^{\varphi_{10}}
              & X_0
              \\ & \cdots \\
              & Z \ar@{-->}[uul]^f \ar[uur]_{f_1} \ar[uurr]_{f_0}
            }
          \end{displaymath}
        \end{defn}
        \begin{claim}
          The projective limit is unique up to (continuous) isomorphism.
          \begin{proof}
            As in the proof of the uniqueness of the product, we see that for any two limits $X$ and $Y$ of the same objects there are unique $p:X\rightarrow Y$ and $q:Y\rightarrow X$.
            By the uniqueness of the induced map in our definition, we then see that $p\circ q=id$ and so $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic.
          \end{proof}
        \end{claim}

        Having defined the (projective) limit of topological spaces in terms of a mapping-property, we hope that such an object does exist.
        To see this, we show that the limit can be constructed as a subset of the product.
        \begin{claim}
          The limit $X$ of topological spaces $X_i$ can be constructed as subset of the product $Y=\prod_i X_i$ (with projections $p_i:Y\rightarrow X_i$).
          Namely, $X$ is the subset of $Y$ on which the transition maps $\varphi_{i,i-1}$ and projections are compatible, so
          \begin{align*}
            X = \{x\in Y: \varphi_{i,i-1}(p_i(x)) = p_{i-1}(x) \text{ for all } i\}
          \end{align*}
          with maps $\varphi_i:X\rightarrow X_i$ given by restrictions of those from the product:
          \begin{align*}
            \varphi_i = p_i|_X :X\rightarrow X_i
          \end{align*}
          \begin{proof}
            Let $j$ be the inclusion map $X\rightarrow Y$.
            Thus we have the diagram
            \begin{displaymath}
              \xymatrix{
                X \ar[r]^j \ar@/^37pt/[rrr]_{\varphi_1} \ar@/^50pt/[rrrr]^{\varphi_0}
                & Y \ar@/^20pt/[rr]_{p_1} \ar@/^30pt/[rrr]^{p_0}
                & \cdots
                & X_1
                & X_0
              }
            \end{displaymath}
            of commuting (curvy) triangles.
            However, the maps $p_i$ do not respect the transition maps of our limit, and so we have the diagram
            \begin{displaymath}
              \xymatrix{
                X \ar[r]^j \ar@/^37pt/[rrr]_{\varphi_1} \ar@/^50pt/[rrrr]^{\varphi_0}
                & Y \ar@/^20pt/@{..>}[rr]_{p_1} \ar@/^30pt/@{..>}[rrr]^{p_0}
                & \cdots \ar[r]^{\varphi_{21}}
                & X_1 \ar[r]^{\varphi_{10}}
                & X_0
              }
            \end{displaymath}
            where solid triangles commute, but not necessarily triangles with dotted edges.
            
            Now, for any space $Z$ and \emph{any} family of maps $f_i$, we have, from the definition of the product, a unique map $F$ so that all triangles commute in the diagram
            \begin{displaymath}
              \xymatrix{
                X \ar[r]^j \ar@/^37pt/[rrr]_{\varphi_1} \ar@/^50pt/[rrrr]^{\varphi_0}
                & Y \ar@/^20pt/[rr]_{p_1} \ar@/^30pt/[rrr]^{p_0}
                & \cdots
                & X_1
                & X_0
                \\ && \cdots \\
                && Z \ar@{-->}[uul]^F \ar[uur]_{f_1} \ar[uurr]_{f_0}
              }
            \end{displaymath}
            However, because we are concerning ourselves with the limit, we suppose that the $f_i$ are compatible with the transition maps $\varphi_{i,i-1}$, so that $f_{i-1} = \varphi_{i,i-1}\circ f_i$.
            We hope that we can find a unique $f:Z\rightarrow X$.
            Taking $z\in Z$, we see that
            \begin{align*}
              p_{i-1}(F(z)) = f_{i-1}(z) = \varphi_{i,i-1}(f_i(z)) = \varphi_{i,i-1}(p_i(F(z)))
            \end{align*}
            By our definition of $X$, $F(z)\in X$, and so $F(Z)\subseteq X$.
            Thus define $f:Z\rightarrow X$ by $f(z) = F(z)$, so we have the diagram with commuting solid or dashed (but not necessarily dotted) triangles
            \begin{displaymath}
              \xymatrix{
                X \ar[r]^j \ar@/^37pt/[rrr]_{\varphi_1} \ar@/^50pt/[rrrr]^{\varphi_0}
                & Y \ar@/^20pt/@{..>}[rr]_{p_1} \ar@/^30pt/@{..>}[rrr]^{p_0}
                & \cdots \ar[r]^{\varphi_{21}}
                & X_1 \ar[r]^{\varphi_{10}}
                & X_0
                \\ && \cdots \\
                && Z \ar@{-->}[uull]^f \ar@{-->}[uul]^F \ar[uur]_{f_1} \ar[uurr]_{f_0}
              }
            \end{displaymath}
            Because the map $F$ is unique by hypothesis, we see that $f$ is unique, and so the compatibility conditions on the $f_i$ cause them to factor through the subset $X$ of the product.
          \end{proof}
        \end{claim}

        Our use of mapping-property characterizations to define the product and limit allow us now to infer the topology of the limit from that of the product.
        Particularly, the (implied) continuity of the maps in our definition allows us to see what the topology must be.
        The result is the \emph{subset topology}: for a subset $X$ of a topological space $Y$, we define a set $U\subseteq X$ to be open in $X$ iff there is some $V$ open in $Y$ such that $U=X\cap V$.%
        \footnote{We can define the subset topology by a mapping-property characterization: we require that inclusion $i:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous, and for any space $Z$ and continuous $F:Z\rightarrow Y$ satisfying $F(Z)\subset X$, there is a unique $f:Z\rightarrow X$ such that $f=i\circ F$.}
        \todo{push some symbol patterns around to show this works}

      \subsection{Indexing by Larger Sets}
        Our present definition of limits allows indexing only by a countable set.
        However, we need to allow more general schemes of ordering limitands in order to take interesting limits.
        Particularly, in taking the limit of the Banach Spaces $C^k_\ell$ with regard to $k$ \emph{and} $\ell$ we hope that a doubly-indexed limit shares the pleasant behaviour of the singly-indexed variety.
        \todo{keep going!}

    \section{\S as a topological limit}
      Recall from \autoref{sec:decayfunc} the spaces $C^k_\ell$ of $k$-times differentiable functions decaying faster than $(1+x^2)^\ell$.
      From \thref{thm:cklcomplete} we have that for all $k,\ell>0$, $C^k_\ell$ is a Banach space (complete normed vectorspace).
      We hope that \S is exactly the (projective) limit of these spaces, but we must show that such a doubly-indexed limit still holds the correct topology.

      First we must define transition maps $\varphi^{k,k-1}_\ell$ and $\phi^k_{\ell,\ell-1}$:
      \begin{displaymath}
        \xymatrix{
          C^1_1  & C^2_1 \ar[l]_{\varphi^{21}_1} & C^3_1 \ar[l]_{\varphi^{32}_1} & \cdots \ar[l]_{\varphi^{43}_1} \\
          C^1_2 \ar[u]_{\phi^1_{21}} & C^2_2 \ar[l]_{\varphi^{21}_2} \ar[u]_{\phi^2_{21}} & \cdots \ar[l]_{\varphi^{32}_2} \ar[u]_{\phi^3_{21}} \\
          C^1_3 \ar[u]_{\phi^1_{32}} & \cdots \ar[l]_{\varphi^{21}_3} \ar[u]_{\phi^2_{32}} \\
          \cdots \ar[u]_{\phi^1_{43}} 
        }
      \end{displaymath}
      These maps must be continuous in order to take the limit, and furthermore, we hope that the above diagram is commutative, so we don't need to worry about what path we take between two spaces.
      \todo{keep going!}
\end{document}
