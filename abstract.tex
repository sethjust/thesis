\chapter*{Abstract}
  The aim of this thesis is to develop a theory of distributions on the on the real number line \R.
  This work culminates in a description of the topological space of ``Schwartz functions'' $\S(\R)$ and its dual space of ``tempered distributions,'' $\SS(\R)$.
  Ultimately we show that any distribution on \R may be approximated arbitrarily well by a sequence of Schwartz functions.
  Throughout the exposition we emphasize topology and characterization by mapping properties.
